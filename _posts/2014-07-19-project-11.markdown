  ### 🌀 Max Payne – Bullet Time  

  *Dev Log – Third-Person Mechanics* is a hands-on **Unity project** where I built cinematic gameplay inspired by the classic bullet-time style. The goal was to create mechanics that feel exciting, polished, and easy for players to enjoy.  

  The focus is on smooth dodging, precise aiming, and immersive audio-visual effects — showing how I combine **technical skills with creative design** to deliver a complete experience.  

  <div style="text-align:left; margin: 10px 0;">  
  • ⏱ **Slow Motion Dodge:** Added time-slowing effects for that iconic bullet-time feel.<br>  
  • 🎥 **Cinematic Camera:** Used Dutch angles and zooms to give every move a movie-like look.<br>  
  • 🔊 **Audio Design:** Built layered sound effects — bullets flying by, casings hitting the ground, and tension-building audio.<br>  
  • 👕 **Cloth & Rustle FX:** Added fabric movement and sound for more realism.<br>  
  • 🔫 **Laser Sight Aiming:** Combined precise aiming with dynamic character motion.<br>  
  • ✨ **Visual Polish:** Improved lighting, shadows, and particles to raise the cinematic quality.<br>  
  </div>  

  This dev log shows how I can **turn ideas into polished gameplay systems**, making it a strong example of my skills for teams looking to hire a Unity developer who values both creativity and execution.
