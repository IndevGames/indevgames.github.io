  ### ❌⭕ Tic Tac Toe – Interactive Large-Screen Edition  

  *Tic Tac Toe* was developed entirely from scratch at **[Aptech Media](https://aptechmedia.com)** for a client project designed for **interactive large screens** used in children’s activity centers.  
  While the concept of Tic Tac Toe is classic, this version required a **custom-built input system** to solve a unique real-world problem — **rapid multi-touch triggering** caused by oversized interactive displays.

  The challenge was that these large screens registered **multiple rapid taps** when users placed their hands on them. To fix this, I implemented a **manual touch-priority system**, ensuring that:
  
  - The **first valid touch** registers immediately.  
  - Any **subsequent touches** are ignored until the player releases their hand.  

  This solution allowed smooth, fair gameplay for two players even under noisy touch input conditions — a critical requirement for reliable large-screen interaction.

  The game also features **three dynamic difficulty modes**:
  
  <div style="text-align:left; margin: 10px 0;">
  • 🟩 **Easy Mode:** Standard static grid — traditional Tic Tac Toe experience.<br>
  • 🟨 **Medium Mode:** Static grid, but with **replaceable symbols** allowing more strategic moves.<br>
  • 🟥 **Hard Mode:** Floating grid with **movable tiles**, increasing challenge and requiring precision touch.<br>
  </div>

  This project demonstrates my ability to **design adaptive interaction systems** and handle **hardware-specific challenges** — combining creativity, input handling, and user experience design.
