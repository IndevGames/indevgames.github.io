  ### 🌍 Mogaland  

  *Mogaland* is an educational adventure game developed in collaboration with an international client team based in Germany. I contributed to this project during my time at **[Aptech Media](https://aptechmedia.com)**, where I was part of a multidisciplinary team responsible for expanding and maintaining the game.

  My main tasks involved integrating a **new map area**, fixing gameplay bugs, and optimizing performance for a smoother and more engaging experience.  

  The workflow was highly collaborative — tasks were tracked in **Jira**, progress was managed via **GitHub**, and each code update was reviewed and merged by our team lead to maintain consistency and quality.

  • 🌍 Implemented a new map with dynamic interactions and optimized asset loading.<br>
  • 🧩 Fixed gameplay and UI bugs reported by QA and the client team.<br>
  • 🔧 Integrated new client-requested features and refined existing systems.<br>
  • 🤝 Collaborated closely with the Germany-based client for updates and feedback.<br>
  • 🧰 Worked within Agile sprints using Jira and Git version control.<br>

  This project strengthened my expertise in **team collaboration**, **client communication**, and **large-scale Unity development** workflows.
