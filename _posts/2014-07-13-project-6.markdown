  ### 🧟 State of Survival: Zombie Game  

  *State of Survival: Zombie Game* is an intense **third-person action survival game** built using the **Invector Controller System**. Players step into a post-apocalyptic world overrun by the undead — battling hordes of zombies and taking on powerful bosses in action-packed combat missions.

  The game offers a deep melee and ranged combat experience with the slow motion action where players can choose from a variety of weapons and play styles:

  <div style="text-align:left; margin: 10px 0;">
  • ⚔️ **Sword, Axe, and Bat Combat:** Engage in close-range battles with smooth, responsive attacks.<br>
  • 🪓 **Throwable Axe:** Inspired by *God of War*, players can throw their axe, **recall it**, and use it again for devastating combos.<br>
  • 🧟 **Zombie & Boss Fights:** Battle through waves of zombies and face challenging boss encounters at the end of each level.<br>
  • 💥 **Level Progression:** Unlock new levels and environments as you advance through the story.<br>
  </div>

  The game also includes **in-app purchases** and a **dual ad system** that uses both **AppLovin** and **AdMob**, ensuring consistent ad performance and monetization even if one network fails.
