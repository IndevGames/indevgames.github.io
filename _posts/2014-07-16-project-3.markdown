  ### ⚔️ Sword Fight: Life of a Gladiator  

  *Sword Fight: Life of a Gladiator* is an intense action game developed at **[Aptech Media](https://aptechmedia.com)**, where I was responsible for expanding the gameplay systems and integrating advanced combat features. The project was part of Aptech Media’s in-house productions, giving me creative freedom to push the combat design and player experience.

  My primary contributions focused on designing **combo systems**, **executions**, and **cutscenes** to make the swordplay dynamic and cinematic. I also integrated **Unity Ads**, **in-app purchases**, and the **Magic Cloth physics package** for realistic character and cloth simulation.  

  The AI enemies were built using a **Finite State Machine (FSM)** architecture, which made their behavior modular, scalable, and easy to extend — a key learning milestone for me in gameplay AI programming.
