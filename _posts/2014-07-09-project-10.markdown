  ### 🔫 Max Payne–Inspired Action Game (Hobby Project)

  This project is a personal hobby and a long-time dream inspired by the iconic **Max Payne** series. Built completely from scratch, the game focuses on stylish third-person action, fluid controls, and cinematic gunplay—powered by the **Unity New Input System**, currently working on both mobile and PC, with easy extension for other controllers.

  The prototype already includes responsive shooting, melee, and dramatic action features:

  <div style="text-align:left; margin: 10px 0;">
  • 🔫 **Pistol Combat:** Smooth and responsive shooting with slow-motion dodge-and-shoot inspired by *Max Payne*.<br><br>
  • 🦾 **Bat Melee Weapon:** Basic close-range attacks with hit detection and damage (cinematic features coming later).<br><br>
  • 🎥 **John Wick–Style Executions:** Dynamic execution system featuring camera arcs, punch zooms, screen shake, and blood-paint effects on hit areas.<br><br>
  • 🧱 **Stylish Cover Pistol Pose:** A character pose system that changes pistol handling when in cover.<br>
  </div>

  More weapons, abilities, enemy types, and cinematic effects are planned as the project continues to grow.
