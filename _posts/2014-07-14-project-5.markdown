  ### 🏀 Ball Hope  

  *Ball Hope* is an addictive **arcade tap game** developed for **Game Creation Studio (USA)** through Fiverr. The game challenges players to **bounce a ball through obstacles** and land it into moving baskets to earn points — a simple yet deeply satisfying gameplay loop that gets more challenging as the player advances.  

  Each level is uniquely designed with increasing difficulty, requiring precise timing and focus to score high. The intuitive **tap-to-jump mechanic** ensures that players can quickly get into the rhythm while facing a variety of **dynamic obstacles and moving hoops**.  

  Players can also **customize their character**, giving a personal touch to their experience. The game features **PlayFab integration**, allowing for **real-time leaderboards** where players compete globally to reach the top score.
