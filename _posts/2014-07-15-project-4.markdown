  ### 🎓 Student Learning App  

  *Student Learning* is a comprehensive **education and assignment management app** developed for a **U.S.-based client (Game Creation Studio)**. The app bridges communication between **teachers and students** using an intuitive PlayFab-powered backend with seamless cloud data synchronization.

  The platform supports two user roles — **Teacher** and **Student**, each with their own dedicated workflow and tools:

  <div style="text-align:left; margin: 10px 0;">
  • 👩‍🏫 **Teacher Mode:** Teachers can create multiple subjects, each with unique **subject codes**. They can view students enrolled in their classes, monitor progress, and check submission details for every unit and assignment.<br>
  • 👨‍🎓 **Student Mode:** Students can log in, enroll using the **teacher name** and **subject code**, and complete assignments in structured sequences.<br>
  • 🧩 **Assignment Structure:** Each subject contains **20 units**, every unit has **20 assignments**, and each assignment includes **30 questions** — designed for progressive learning.<br>
  • 📬 **Messaging System:** Enables teachers and students to communicate directly. Teachers can send feedback such as *“Needs improvement”*, and students receive messages in their app dashboard.<br>
  • ⏱️ **Detailed Submission Tracking:** Teachers can view which questions were answered correctly or incorrectly, along with **submission date, time, and performance summary**.<br>
  </div>

  This project showcases my experience in **PlayFab integration**, **user authentication systems**, **cloud-based data storage**, and **interactive education platform design**. The result is a full-featured learning ecosystem that simplifies remote teaching and student performance tracking.
