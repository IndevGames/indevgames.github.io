  ### 🎮 Super Hero: Justice War League  

  *Super Hero: Justice War League* was my first complete 3D superhero action game, developed entirely from scratch using **Unity** and the **Invector Third Person Controller** framework.  

  I expanded the base controller with several advanced gameplay features:  

  <div style="text-align:left; margin: 10px 0;">
  • 🕹️ Grappling, fire blow, fireball attacks, and flying ability for dynamic superhero movement.<br>
  • 👊 Unarmed combat system with responsive animations and combo logic.<br>
  • 🤖 Enemy group AI where opponents engage the player one by one in coordinated combat.<br>
  • 💰 Integrated monetization systems such as ads and in-app purchases.<br>
  • 🧭 Interactive main menu and polished UI for smooth navigation.<br>
  </div>

  This project was a major step in my game development journey — combining gameplay programming, animation setup, and system integration into a complete, playable experience.
